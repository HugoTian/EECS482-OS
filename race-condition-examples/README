To compile: do "make all". Edit Makefile if you need to change how the code
		is compiled.

	Tested platform: Linux. Uses /dev/urandom on Linux.


race1: code with race conditions in printing using fork(). 
	But race conditions are unlikely to show up because machines are 
	too fast. 

race2: same code as race1, but the code is slowed down with random delays.
	Race conditions are likely to show up. Different results may
	print on different runs.

race3: Race conditions on a shared variable using threads. Also uses
	random delays to slow down the threads and make it more likely
	that context-switches will take place in different orders in a small
	number of runs.

	This code uses the POSIX pthread library.
